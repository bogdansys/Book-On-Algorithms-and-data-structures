## Edge List

An edge list is a way of representing a graph as a list of edges, where each edge is represented by a tuple of two vertices (or nodes). Each vertex is represented by its unique identifier, such as an integer or a string. For example, in an undirected graph with 3 vertices (A, B, C) and 3 edges (A-B, B-C, C-A), the edge list representation would be: [(A,B), (B,C), (C,A)]. This representation is useful for sparse graphs, as it only stores the edges that exist, and doesn't require any additional memory for non-existent edges.

The main advantage of edge list representation is that it is simple and easy to implement, it doesn't require too much memory and it is suitable for sparse graphs. The main disadvantage is that it doesn't provide an easy way to access all edges incident to a given vertex.

## Adjacency list

 his is a collection of linked lists, where each list represents the edges connected to a specific vertex. This is a memory-efficient representation for sparse graphs (graphs with a low number of edges compared to the number of vertices).

## Adjacency map

An adjacency map is a way of representing a graph as a map (also known as a dictionary or a hash map) of vertices to their adjacent vertices. Each vertex is represented by a key, and the value associated with that key is a collection of vertices that are adjacent to it.

## Adjacency Matrix

This is a two-dimensional matrix, where each cell represents the presence or absence of an edge between two vertices. This is a memory-efficient representation for dense graphs (graphs with a high number of edges compared to the number of vertices).

# Traversals

## Depth First traversal of a graph

```java
private boolean[] visited;

    public void dfs(int[][] graph, int vertex) {
        visited[vertex] = true;
        System.out.print(vertex + " ");
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (graph[vertex][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                dfs(graph, i);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Breadth first search BFS

```java
public void bfs(int[][] graph, int vertex) {
        visited[vertex] = true;
        queue.add(vertex);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int current = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(current + " ");
            for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
                if (graph[current][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                    visited[i] = true;
                    queue.add(i);
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

Depth-first traversal is a method of traversing a graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The algorithm starts at the root node (or any arbitrary node) and explores each branch as far as possible before backtracking. (recursing)

Here is the basic algorithm for depth-first traversal of a graph:

1. Start at the root node (or any arbitrary node) and mark it as visited.
2. For each adjacent vertex of the current vertex that has not been visited, recursively call the depth-first traversal function with that vertex as the new current vertex.
3. Once all adjacent vertices have been visited, backtrack to the previous vertex and mark it as fully visited.

Here is the basic algorithm for BFS:

1. Start at the root node (or any arbitrary node) and mark it as visited.
2. Add the current vertex to a queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
a. Dequeue the first vertex from the queue.
b. For each adjacent vertex of the current vertex that has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.

# Graph Algorithms !!!

# Detecting a cycle using dfs

Do normal dfs but if you come across a vertex that has already been visited → Cycle found.

## Counting connected components.

```java
class ConnectedComponents {
    private int count;
    private boolean[] visited;

    public int countConnectedComponents(int[][] graph) {
        int V = graph.length;
        visited = new boolean[V];
        count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                count++;
                dfs(graph, i);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] graph, int vertex) {
        visited[vertex] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (graph[vertex][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                dfs(graph, i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here's one way to count the connected components of a graph using the Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable **`count`** to 0 to keep track of the number of connected components.
2. Create a boolean array **`visited`** of size **`V`** where **`V`** is the number of vertices in the graph.
3. For each vertex **`i`** in the graph, if it has not been visited yet:
a. Increment the count.
b. Call the DFS function with the vertex **`i`** and the **`visited`** array.
c. Mark all the vertices visited during this DFS as visited in the **`visited`** array.
4. Return the **`count`** variable.

## Path Finding using DFS

```java
class PathFinder {
    private boolean[] visited;
    public boolean hasPath(int[][] graph, int start, int end) {
        int V = graph.length;
        visited = new boolean[V];
        return dfs(graph, start, end);
    }

    private boolean dfs(int[][] graph, int vertex, int end) {
        visited[vertex] = true;
        if (vertex == end) {
            return true;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (graph[vertex][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                if (dfs(graph, i, end)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

1. Create a boolean array **`visited`** of size **`V`** where **`V`** is the number of vertices in the graph.
2. Create a stack to store the current path.
3. Call the DFS function with the start vertex, end vertex, and the **`visited`** array.
4. In the DFS function:
a. Mark the current vertex as visited.
b. Add the current vertex to the current path stack.
c. If the current vertex is the end vertex, return the current path stack.
d. For each adjacent vertex of the current vertex that has not been visited, call the DFS function with that vertex as the new current vertex.
e. Backtrack by removing the current vertex from the current path stack.
5. Return null if no path is found.

# Topological sorting (this is what you fucked up last year)

```java
class TopologicalSort {
    private boolean[] visited;
    private Stack<Integer> stack;

    public Stack<Integer> topologicalSort(int[][] graph) {
        int V = graph.length;
        visited = new boolean[V];
        stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(graph, i);
            }
        }
        return stack;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] graph, int vertex) {
        visited[vertex] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (graph[vertex][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                dfs(graph, i);
            }
        }
        stack.push(vertex);
    }
}
```

Topological sorting is an algorithm for ordering the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering.

Here's one way to find a topological order of a DAG using the Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm:

1. Create a boolean array **`visited`** of size **`V`** where **`V`** is the number of vertices in the graph.
2. Create a stack to store the topological order.
3. For each vertex **`i`** in the graph, if it has not been visited yet:
a. Call the DFS function with the vertex **`i`** and the **`visited`** array.
b. Add the current vertex to the stack after all its adjacent vertices have been visited.
4. Return the stack containing the topological order.

# Dijkstra’s algorithm  (uses Pq)

```java
class Dijkstra {
    public int[] shortestPath(int[][] graph, int start) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] distance = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(distance, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        distance[start] = 0;
        PriorityQueue<Node> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.distance - b.distance);
        pq.offer(new Node(start, 0));
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Node curr = pq.poll();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (graph[curr.vertex][i] != 0) {
                    int newDistance = distance[curr.vertex] + graph[curr.vertex][i];
                    if (newDistance < distance[i]) {
                        distance[i] = newDistance;
                        pq.offer(new Node(i, newDistance));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return distance;
    }
    private class Node {
        int vertex, distance;
        public Node(int vertex, int distance) {
            this.vertex = vertex;
            this.distance = distance;
        }
    }
}
```

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It is based on the idea of relaxing the edges of the graph, where the weight of an edge is relaxed if a shorter path is found.

Here is the basic algorithm for Dijkstra's shortest path:

1. Create a priority queue to store the vertices and their distances from the starting vertex.
2. Initialize the distance of the starting vertex to 0 and the distance of all other vertices to infinity.
3. Add the starting vertex to the priority queue.
4. While the priority queue is not empty:
a. Dequeue the vertex with the minimum distance.
b. For each adjacent vertex of the current vertex, if the distance of the adjacent vertex can be relaxed (i.e., the distance can be shortened by going through the current vertex), update its distance and add it to the priority queue.
5. Once the algorithm has finished, the distance to each vertex in the priority queue represents the shortest path to that vertex from the starting vertex.

# Minimum Spanning Tree MST

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subgraph of an undirected, connected and weighted graph that connects all the vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight. In other words, it is a tree that spans all the vertices in the graph and the sum of the weights of its edges is minimum among all the possible spanning trees of that graph.

There are several algorithms for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph such as Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. Both algorithms are based on the greedy strategy, where at each step, the next edge to be added to the tree is the one with the lowest weight that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex not in the tree.

Kruskal's algorithm starts with an empty tree and repeatedly adds the minimum-weight edge that doesn't create a cycle

Minimum Spanning Trees have many practical applications such as network design, image segmentation, and more. They are also used in the field of computational biology to study the evolution of species.

	  public static List < Edge > buildMST ( int n , List < Edge > edges ) {

				  sortedEdges.add ( edgeWalker );
			}
			
			while (!sortedEdges.isEmpty ())
			{
				  Edge x = sortedEdges.poll();
				  // if the To and From come from different sets, then we unite the sets and add the edge
				  if (unionFind.find ( x.getFrom () ) != unionFind.find ( x.getTo ( ) )){
						unionFind.union ( x.getFrom (), x.getTo () );
						mst.add ( x );
				  }
				  
			}
			
			return mst;
			
	  }

}
```

Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. The minimum spanning tree is a tree that spans all the vertices in the graph, with the minimum possible total edge weight.

The algorithm starts by sorting all the edges in the graph in ascending order of their weights. Then, it iterates through the edges and adds them to the MST if and only if adding the edge does not form a cycle. To check if adding an edge creates a cycle, the algorithm uses a disjoint set data structure to keep track of which vertices are connected to each other.

The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Sort all the edges in the graph in ascending order of their weights.
2. Initialize a disjoint set data structure to keep track of connected vertices.
3. Iterate through all the edges in the graph:
a. Use the disjoint set data structure to find the sets containing the source and destination vertices of the current edge.
b. If the source and destination vertices are in different sets, add the edge to the minimum spanning tree and union the two sets.
c. If the source and destination vertices are in the same set, discard the edge as it would create a cycle.
4. Repeat steps 3 until all the vertices are connected in a single set, which forms the minimum spanning tree.

Kruskal's algorithm runs in O(E log E) time, where E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because the algorithm needs to sort the edges, which takes O(E log E) time, and then iterate through the edges, which takes O(E) time.
